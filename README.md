# Green Year CLI üå≥


> A command-line tool to fill your GitHub contribution graph with fake commits. Make every day look like a productive day\!

Ever wanted to paint your GitHub contribution graph a solid green? Or maybe you're testing tools that interact with Git history? `green-year` is a simple CLI tool that allows you to generate a commit history for any given date range, with a randomized number of commits per day to make it look more authentic.

*(You would need to create a GIF like this to make the README even better\!)*

## ü§î Why?

  * **Aesthetics:** For developers who love seeing a fully green contribution graph.
  * **Testing:** Create repositories with a dense commit history for testing Git-related tools or scripts.
  * **Privacy:** If you work in a private repository, your contributions don't show up. This tool can help you maintain a green public profile without exposing proprietary work.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Custom Date Ranges:** Specify any start and end date.
  * **Randomized Commit Frequency:** Creates a variable number of commits each day to look more natural.
  * **Configurable Intensity:** You can control the minimum and maximum number of commits per day.
  * **Easy to Use:** A simple, straightforward command-line interface.
  * **Safe:** Operates in a specific directory, preventing accidental changes to other projects.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning

This tool rewrites Git history. It is **highly recommended** to use it **only** on a new, empty repository created specifically for this purpose. Using it on an existing repository with important history can lead to data loss. The final step requires a **force push**, which is a destructive action. **Use with caution\!**

## üì¶ Installation

You can install `green-year` globally using npm, which will make the `green-year` command available in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g green-year
```

*(Note: You need to publish your package to npm for this to work. The package name `green-year` might already be taken.)*

## üöÄ Usage

The basic command requires a start date and an end date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### Command

```bash
green-year <startDate> <endDate> [options]
```

### Arguments

  * `<startDate>`: The start date for generating commits (e.g., `2024-01-01`).
  * `<endDate>`: The end date for generating commits (e.g., `2024-12-31`).

### Options

  * `--repo`, `-r`: Path to the local Git repository. (Default: current directory `.`)
  * `--min`: The minimum number of commits per day. (Default: `1`)
  * `--max`: The maximum number of commits per day. (Default: `5`)
  * `--help`, `-h`: Display the help menu.
  * `--version`, `-v`: Display the package version.

### Examples

**1. Fill the entire year of 2024 with default activity (1-5 commits/day):**

```bash
# First, create and navigate to a new directory
mkdir my-green-year
cd my-green-year
git init

# Run the command
green-year 2024-01-01 2024-12-31
```

**2. Create a more intense commit history for a specific quarter:**

```bash
green-year 2025-01-01 2025-03-31 --min 5 --max 15
```

**3. Create subtle activity, allowing for days with no commits:**

```bash
green-year 2024-07-01 2024-09-30 --min 0 --max 2
```

### After Running the Command

Once the script finishes, you need to push the history to your GitHub repository.

```bash
# 1. Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# 2. Force push the new history to the main branch
git push -u origin main --force
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The script iterates through each day in your specified date range. For each day, it:

1.  Generates a random number of commits based on your `--min` and `--max` settings.
2.  For each commit, it creates a unique message and content.
3.  It then uses the `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` and `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` environment variables to set the commit's timestamp to the correct historical date.
4.  Finally, it runs `git commit` with the backdated information.

## üíª Development

Interested in contributing? Here‚Äôs how to get started.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/clare-codex/green-year.git
    cd green-year
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Link the package for local testing:**
    `npm link` creates a global symlink to your local project directory. This allows you to run the `green-year` command anywhere on your system and have it execute your local development code.

    ```bash
    npm link
    ```

4.  **Make your changes and test them\!**
    You can now open a new terminal window, navigate to a test repository, and run the `green-year` command with your changes.
